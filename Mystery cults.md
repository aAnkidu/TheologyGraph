[[Pagan religions in GRW]]

Mystery cults appear to have placed some emphasis (older scholarship believed it was exclusive emphasis) on providing a happy existence in the life after death.

Each of the mystery cults was different; each had its own special location and its own customs and rituals. Many of them evidently centered around a mythology of the **death and resurrection of a god or goddess**, a mythology ultimately rooted in ancient fertility religion, in which the death of winter gives way to the new life of spring.

Moreover, the periodic ritual of these cults apparently celebrated this mythology in a way that enabled the participants to become part of the entire transformative process of new life. That is to say, the enacted myth about the gods was transmuted into reality for the devotees, who believed they would live again, happily, after death. For those who had been found worthy to be a follower of the mysteryâ€™s god or goddess, there was promised not only a more satisfying existence now but also a more blissful **afterlife**.

Each of them appears to have emphasized rituals of initiation for membership. Those who wished to join were typically put through a period of ceremonial cleansing (involving fastings, prayers, and sometimes ritual washings) and instruction prior to being admitted to the ranks of the devotees.
