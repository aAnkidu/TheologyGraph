#### **[[🏛️ Babylonian Empire]]** (605–539 B.C.E.)

- In **587/586 B.C.E.**, the Babylonian king **Nebuchadnezzar II** destroyed **Jerusalem** and the **[[🕍 First Temple]]**, exiling many Jews to Babylon — a key event known as the **Babylonian Exile**
#### **[[🏛️ Persian Empire]] (Achaemenid)** (539–331 B.C.E.)

- In **539 B.C.E.**, **Cyrus the Great** of Persia conquered Babylon and allowed exiled peoples, including Jews, to return home.
- The **[[🕍 Second Temple]]** was rebuilt (~516 B.C.E.).

#### **Greek Rule – Hellenistic Period (Alexander & Successors)** (331–63 B.C.E.)

- **Alexander the Grea** conquered the Persian Empire in the **330s B.C.E.**, spreading **Greek language and culture** (Hellenization).
- After his death in **323 B.C.E.**, his empire was divided among his generals, leading to two key Hellenistic powers relevant to Judea:
    ✅ **[[🏛️ Ptolemaic Empire]]** (based in Egypt):
    - Controlled Judea from **~320 to 200 B.C.E.**
    - Relatively tolerant; Jewish life and the priesthood continued with little interference.
    
    ✅ **[[🏛️ Seleucid Empire]]** (based in Syria/Mesopotamia):
    - Took control of Judea around **200 B.C.E.**
    - Became increasingly oppressive under **Antiochus IV Epiphanes**, who tried to **enforce Hellenization** and suppress Jewish practices.        
    - His actions (including desecrating the Temple) triggered the **[[Maccabean Revolt]]** (167–160 B.C.E.).
    - The revolt led to the establishment of the **Hasmonean dynasty** and temporary **Jewish independence** (~142–63 B.C.E.).

#### **[[🏛️ Roman Rule]]** (63 B.C.E.–onward)

- In **63 B.C.E.**, the Roman general **Pompey the Great** intervened in a **[[🏛️ Hasmonean Dynasty]]** civil war and **captured Jerusalem**, placing **Judea under Roman control** as a **client kingdom**.
- Though **local kings** continued to rule, they did so only **with Roman approval**, and **Rome retained ultimate authority** over foreign policy, military, and taxation.

###### 📍**Roman Client Kingdom (63–6 B.C.E.)**

- Judea remained semi-independent but **subordinate to Rome**.
- **Antipater the Idumean**, a Roman-appointed administrator, and later his son **[[👑 Herod the Great]]**, became the key political figures.
- In **37 B.C.E.**, **Herod** was officially declared **“King of the Jews”** by the Roman Senate. He ruled **as a client king** until his death in **4 B.C.E.**
    - Herod maintained Roman loyalty while **expanding Judean territory** and **rebuilding the [[🕍 Second Temple]]**.
    - His rule marked the **end of Hasmonean political power**, though he married into the family for legitimacy.        

###### 📍 **Division and Direct Roman Rule (6 C.E.–66 C.E.)**

- After Herod’s death, his kingdom was divided among his sons.
- **In 6 C.E.**, after removing **Archelaus**, Rome made **Judea a Roman province**, directly ruled by **Roman governors** (prefects or procurators).
    - The most famous was **[[⚖️ Pontius Pilate]]** (26–36 C.E.), who presided over the trial of **Jesus of Nazareth**.
- The **Jewish high priesthood** and **Sanhedrin** remained active in religious affairs, but political power lay with Rome.
    

###### 📍 **[[⚔️ First Jewish–Roman War]] & Destruction of the Temple (66–73 C.E.)**

- Growing resentment toward Roman taxation, corruption, and desecration of the Temple sparked the **First Jewish Revolt** in **66 C.E.**
- In **70 C.E.**, Roman general **Titus** (son of Emperor Vespasian) **destroyed Jerusalem and the Second Temple**, a catastrophic event in Jewish history.
- The war ended in **73 C.E.** with the **siege of Masada**.
###### 📍 **Judea as Roman Province (70–135 C.E.)**

- After the war, Judea was more tightly integrated into the empire.
- The region was later renamed **“Syria Palaestina”** after the **[[⚔️ Bar Kokhba revolt]]** (132–135 C.E.) under Emperor **Hadrian**, as part of a Roman effort to erase Jewish identity from the land.
