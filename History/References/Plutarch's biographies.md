"Life of Alexander the Great"
 Plutarch’s "Lives"
 
Plutarch (46–120 C.E.), one of antiquity’s most famous biographers, wrote _Lives_ to illustrate moral character through small moments rather than grand achievements. In his _Life of Alexander_, he explains that a person’s soul is often better revealed in a joke or gesture than in a major battle. Like a portrait artist focusing on the eyes, Plutarch emphasized character-revealing details over historical completeness.

🗣️ _“I am writing not histories but lives... Often a trifling incident, a word or a jest, shows more of his character than the battles where he slays thousands.”_ — _Plutarch, Life of Alexander, ch. 1_
