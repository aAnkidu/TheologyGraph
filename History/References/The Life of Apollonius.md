Apollonius of Tyana was a 1st-century pagan teacher and miracle-worker, whose life was later recorded by Philostratus in the 3rd century CE. Stories about him include healing the sick, casting out demons, predicting the future, and ascending to heaven — all traits also attributed to Jesus. His example shows that miracle-working “divine men” (_theioi andres_) were common in the Greco-Roman world. Jesus, though unique in Christian tradition, was one of many such figures believed to be supernaturally endowed in that era.
