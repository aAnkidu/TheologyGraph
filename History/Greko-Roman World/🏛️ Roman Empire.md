Rome was traditionally founded in 753 B.C.E. as a small farming village on seven hills. Initially ruled by kings, Rome became a republic in 510 B.C.E. governed by the Senate, an aristocratic oligarchy. Romeâ€™s military strength grew, allowing it to conquer the Italian peninsula and dominate the Mediterranean after the Punic Wars with Carthage (264â€“146 B.C.E.).

The late republic was marked by violent power struggles, culminating in Julius Caesarâ€™s assassination in 44 B.C.E. The republic ended when Caesarâ€™s great-nephew Octavian (later Augustus) became the first emperor in 27 B.C.E., establishing imperial rule with supreme authority, though the Senate continued some governance.

Romeâ€™s empire expanded from Spain to Syria, governed by senators and the equestrian class. Key emperors during the early imperial period include Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian.
