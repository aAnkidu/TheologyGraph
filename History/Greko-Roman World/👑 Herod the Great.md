### Herod the Great and Judea

Herod the Great ruled Judea from 37 BCE to 4 BCE under Roman authority. Although not of pure Jewish descent, he was appointed king by the Romans, marking the end of Hasmonean political independence. His reign was marked by significant building projects, including the expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, which helped legitimize his rule among the Jewish population.

Herod was known for his political savvy and ruthless methods to maintain power, including eliminating rivals and suppressing opposition. His relationship with the Jewish people was complex‚Äîwhile he supported Jewish religious institutions, many viewed him as a Roman puppet and an outsider.

Despite this, Herod‚Äôs rule brought relative stability to Judea and positioned it as an important client kingdom within the [[üèõÔ∏è Roman Empire]]. His legacy influenced the political and religious landscape into the time of Jesus.
