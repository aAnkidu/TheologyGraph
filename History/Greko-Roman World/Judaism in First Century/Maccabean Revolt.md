### 🛡️ The Maccabean Revolt (167–160 BCE)

The **Maccabean Revolt** was a Jewish uprising against rule of  **[[🏛️ Seleucid Empire]]**, sparked by intense resistance to **forced [[Hellenization]]** and the desecration of the Jewish Temple.

#### 🏛️ Background: Hellenization and Jewish Identity

After the conquests of **Alexander the Great**, the eastern Mediterranean was increasingly influenced by **Greek (Hellenistic) culture**. In Judea, some elites embraced this culture—adopting Greek language, customs, philosophy, and gymnasiums. However, traditionalist Jews viewed these practices as a threat to **Torah observance** and Jewish identity. 

### ⚖️ Internal Conflict Over Hellenization

There was also significant **internal conflict within Judaism** over the degree to which Jews should accept Greek culture. This tension arose from a basic question:  
**"How Greek should we be?"**

- Greek culture was dominant in the upper classes.
- For Jews who wanted their children to succeed in **elite education, government, or commerce**, adopting some level of Hellenization was practically necessary.
- This led to a cultural and religious divide between **Hellenized Jews** (often urban elites) and **traditional Jews** (often rural or priestly families). [[Menelaus]] was one Jews that for Hellenization
- The conflict was not just political, but deeply **religious and social**, influencing how people understood identity, piety, and loyalty to God's law.

#### 👑 Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Religious Oppression

The Seleucid king **Antiochus IV Epiphanes** escalated tensions:

- He attempted to unify his realm under Greek religion and culture.
- In **167 BCE**, he **outlawed Jewish practices** (like Sabbath observance and circumcision) and **desecrated the Temple**, dedicating it to Zeus and sacrificing pigs on the altar.
This direct attack on Jewish religion provoked widespread outrage.

#### 🧔‍ Menelaus and Internal Conflict

A crucial part of the crisis was internal. **Menelaus**, a **Hellenized Jew**, bribed his way into becoming **High Priest**, replacing the more traditional Onias III.

- Menelaus **sold Temple treasures** to pay off his debts to the Seleucids.
- His corrupt actions and close alliance with Antiochus IV made him a **symbol of betrayal** to many Jews.
- His appointment highlighted the deep division between **Hellenizers** and traditionalists.

#### ⚔️ The Revolt

The revolt was led by **Mattathias**, a priest from the village of Modein, and later by his son **Judas Maccabeus** ("the Hammer"):

- They led a **guerrilla war** against the Seleucids and Hellenized Jews.
- In **164 BCE**, Judas and his forces **recaptured Jerusalem** and **rededicated the Temple**, an event commemorated by **Hanukkah**.
- The revolt continued under his brothers and eventually led to **the Hasmonean dynasty**, granting the Jews a period of political independence.

#### 📜 Results and Legacy

- **Temple purified and rededicated**: Central to Jewish religious memory and celebrated in **Hanukkah**.
- **Hasmonean dynasty established** (140s–37 BCE): Jewish priest-kings ruled Judea semi-independently for about a century.
- **Jewish national and religious identity strengthened**, with the Law and the Temple at its center.
- **Resistance to Hellenistic influence** became a dominant theme in Jewish thought and memory.
- The revolt and its literature (e.g., **1–2 Maccabees**) later inspired Jewish resistance movements, including those against Rome.
