**First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 C.E.)**

The **First Jewish–Roman War**, or **Great Revolt**, was a major uprising of the Jews in Judea against Roman rule. It began in **66 C.E.** due to long-standing tensions over taxation, Roman disrespect for Jewish religion, and growing frustration with imperial domination.

✨ The revolt initially succeeded: Jewish forces took **Jerusalem** and defeated a Roman legion.  
⚔️ In response, the Roman Empire sent powerful legions under **Vespasian** and later his son **Titus**.  
🔥 In **70 C.E.**, Roman troops **destroyed the Second Temple** in Jerusalem — a central and traumatic event in Jewish history.  
🏰 The war ended in **73 C.E.** with the Roman **siege of Masada**, where the last Jewish defenders reportedly chose **mass suicide** over surrender.

The war resulted in massive casualties, destruction across Judea, and marked a turning point in Jewish history with increased diaspora and Roman control.
