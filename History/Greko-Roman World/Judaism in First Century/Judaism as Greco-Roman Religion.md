Around **550 B.C.E.**, the **Babylonian exile** forced many Judeans out of their homeland due to war, political collapse, and economic disruption. Many resettled in **Babylonia and Egypt**, where they continued to worship the **God of Israel**, though without access to the **Jerusalem Temple**, which lay in ruins for decades.

In **[[Greco-Roman World]]**, being **Jewish** meant worshipping **the God of Israel** and following Judean customs, whether in **Palestine or abroad**. Jews living outside of Judea were said to be in the **Diaspora** (literally, _dispersion_). By the time of Jesus, **most Jews lived outside Palestine**, and some estimates suggest Jews made up **about 7%** of the Roman Empire’s population (~60 million). **Egypt alone** had twice as many Jews as Palestine.

Over time, most Diaspora Jews **stopped speaking Hebrew**. By the **2nd century B.C.E.**, many read or heard **Scripture in Greek**, especially through the **[[Septuagint]]**, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible.

Thus a distinctive feature of Jews around the world was that they did not worship a god of their own locality but the one God of their distant homeland, the God of Israel, and no other. Moreover, they claimed that this God had shown them special favor. For most non-Jews this was thought to be an audacious claim (even though Romans, as we have seen, made similar claims about their own gods). Jews nonetheless maintained that the one God, the creator of heaven and earth, was uniquely their God. Hence, the second distinctive aspect of Judaism: their belief in the pact that God had made with Israel, or, using their own term, [[The Covenant]].
