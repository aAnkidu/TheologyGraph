- The **synagogue** (from Greek _“gathering together”_) was the **center of Jewish worship** outside [[🕍 Second Temple]], especially in the **Diaspora**.
- Unlike [[🕍 Second Temple]], synagogues did **not involve animal sacrifice**. Worship focused on **reading and discussing the Torah**, **prayer**, and **communal gathering**, especially on the **Sabbath**.
- Meetings took place in **homes or dedicated buildings**, led by **literate members** of the community.
- By Jesus’ time, **synagogues existed wherever Jewish communities** were found—in **Palestine and throughout the Roman Empire**, as a practical alternative for Jews who could not travel to Jerusalem

	- Including **men, women, and children**
	- Meeting **weekly**
	- Focusing on **worship and Scripture**, not just social or economic concerns
