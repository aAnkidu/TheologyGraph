### 🕊️ Hasideans (Hebrew: _Hasidim_)

The Hasideans were a group of devout and traditionalist Jews who emerged during the time of the [[Maccabean Revolt]]. Their name, meaning “the pious” or “the faithful,” reflects their deep commitment to the observance of the Torah and opposition to the growing influence of Hellenistic culture. Initially, they supported the Maccabees in their fight against religious persecution under Seleucid rule, seeing the revolt as a defense of Jewish faith and law. However, once the movement began to take on more political and nationalistic goals, the Hasideans distanced themselves, as their primary concern was religious fidelity rather than political power.

Some scholars believe that the Hasideans may have practiced early forms of asceticism and communal piety, possibly resembling later monastic movements. While their exact identity remains debated, they are sometimes associated with the Essenes or seen as spiritual predecessors. This has led to speculation about their potential influence on, or even connection with, the group responsible for the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], who also emphasized strict Torah observance, purity, and separation from what they viewed as a corrupt society.
