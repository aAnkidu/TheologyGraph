The Hasmonean Dynasty emerged after the [[Maccabean Revolt]] (167â€“160 BCE), a Jewish uprising against Seleucid rule and forced Hellenization led by Judas Maccabeus. Following their victory, the Hasmoneans established an independent Jewish state.

Simon Maccabeus was appointed high priest and ruler in 140 BCE, marking a rare combination of religious and political power. Later rulers expanded the territory but faced internal divisions, especially with groups like the Pharisees and Sadducees.

Roman intervention in 63 BCE ended their independence. The dynasty formally ended when [[Herod the Great ]]took power, backed by Rome, and married into the Hasmonean line.
