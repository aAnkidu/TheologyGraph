https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple
The **Jerusalem Temple** was the **central place of worship** for Jews, where **animal sacrifices** were offered in accordance with the **Torah**. It was regarded as the **only legitimate place** to worship the **God of Israel**, who was believed to dwell in the **Holy of Holies**—a sacred, empty room symbolizing God’s **invisibility and holiness**, unlike the idol-filled temples of other religions.

The **Second Temple**, originally built after the Babylonian exile and later **massively expanded by [[Herod the Great]]**, stood as one of the **most impressive religious structures** of the ancient world:

- Spanned an area of **25 football fields**
- Featured **100-foot-high walls**, grand **stone gates**, and lavish **gold decoration**
- Employed **18,000 workers** and was completed around **63 C.E.**

Jews from across the empire paid a **yearly Temple tax**, even if they never visited, emphasizing the Temple’s **centrality in Jewish identity and worship**.

💥 **Connection to the Great Revolt (66–70 C.E.):**  
During the **[[⚔️ First Jewish–Roman War]]**, Jewish rebels seized Jerusalem, and the Temple became a key stronghold. In retaliation, the Romans—under **Titus**—laid siege to the city.

🔥 In **70 C.E.**, the **Second Temple was destroyed**, a **traumatic and transformative moment** in Jewish history. It **ended the sacrificial system**, reshaped Jewish religious life, and became a powerful symbol of both **loss and resilience**.
