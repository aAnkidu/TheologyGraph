Alexander the Great promoted the **Greek language**, built **Greek-style cities** (with _gymnasiums_, _theaters_, and _public baths_), and encouraged the spread of **Greek culture and religion**, especially among the **upper classes**. Historians call this process _Hellenization_ (from _Hellas_, the Greek name for Greece).

After his death in **323 B.C.E.**, his empire was divided among generals, but **Hellenistic culture** continued to dominate urban centers in the eastern Mediterranean. Despite shifting political boundaries, **Greek remained the lingua franca**, and Greek customs and institutions unified the region culturally.

The **[[üèõÔ∏è Roman Empire]]** emerged within this Hellenized context and **embraced Greek language, culture, and religion**, often merging **Greek and Roman deities** under different names. This cultural and political fusion is referred to as the **Greco-Roman world**.

Hellenization also influenced how people perceived gods in  [[Pagan religions in GRW]]

Salvation in paganism, according to **Yehezkel Kaufman**, was often understood as **circumventing the gods** or **accessing hidden knowledge (gnosis)** to tap into the **metadivine realm**‚Äîa level of power beyond the gods themselves. Through ritual, magic, or secret wisdom, one could manipulate these cosmic forces to gain control or liberation.
