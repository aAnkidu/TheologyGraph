The term **“Greco-Roman world”** refers to the **cultural, political, and social environment shaped by the fusion of Greek and Roman civilization**, roughly from the time of **[[👑 Alexander the Great]] (late 4th century B.C.E.)** through the **end of the Western Roman Empire (5th century C.E.)**.

Alexander the Grea promoted the **Greek language**, built **Greek-style cities** (with _gymnasiums_, _theaters_, and _public baths_), and encouraged the spread of **Greek culture and religion**, especially among the **upper classes**. Historians call this process _Hellenization_ (from _Hellas_, the Greek name for Greece).

After his death in **323 B.C.E.**, his empire was divided among generals, but **Hellenistic culture** continued to dominate urban centers in the eastern Mediterranean. Despite shifting political boundaries, **Greek remained the lingua franca**, and Greek customs and institutions unified the region culturally.

The **[[🏛️ Roman Empire]]** emerged within this Hellenized context and **embraced Greek language, culture, and religion**, often merging **Greek and Roman deities** under different names. This cultural and political fusion is referred to as the **Greco-Roman world**.

Hellenization also influenced how people perceived gods in  [[Pagan religions in GRW]]
