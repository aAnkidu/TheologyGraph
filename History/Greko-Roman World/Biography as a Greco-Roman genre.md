[[ðŸ“œ Gospels]]
Greco-Roman biographies, like those by Plutarch and Suetonius, focused less on factual accuracy or psychological development than modern biographies. Instead of explaining how people changed over time, they aimed to reveal a personâ€™s stable character traits through stories and events. Oral tradition was often the main source, and chronological order was used mainly for structure, not to trace growth. Biographies were meant to portray exemplary lives for readers to admire and imitate.

Ancient Greco-Roman biographies (Greek: _bioi_) focused less on historical precision and more on conveying the essential, enduring character traits of a subject. They aimed not to document development but to **illustrate moral character**â€”virtues to imitate and vices to avoid. The goal was often **instructional or inspirational**, rather than informational or psychological.

Biographers used **anecdotes, sayings, speeches, and stories of conflict** drawn from **oral tradition** to portray these traits. Since personality was thought to be stable throughout life, a subjectâ€™s responses to events were used to show who they _were_, not who they _became_. Miraculous elements often featured prominently in biographies of religious figures (e.g., Philostratusâ€™s _Life of Apollonius_), especially at birth or death.

ðŸ“Œ **Example: [[Plutarch's biographies]]**  

Many modern scholars now agree that the New Testament [[ðŸ“œ Gospels]] are best understood as a specific form of **Greco-Roman biography**â€”focused on a religious figure. While they contain **distinctive features**, such variation is expected, as ancient literary genres often included flexible subtypes depending on the subject (e.g., rulers, philosophers, or religious figures).

Ancient readers or hearers would have recognized the Gospels as **biographies of a religious leader**, even if they had never encountered Jesus before. They would anticipate that:

- The **main character** is central to the action.
    
- His **identity and character** would be evident from the start.
    
- He would perform **divinely inspired teachings and superhuman deeds**.
    
- There would be **miraculous events** at both the beginning and end of his life.
    
- Rather than inner psychological development, readers would expect to see **fixed character traits** expressed through **responses to external challenges**.
    

The Gospels' strong emphasis on Jesusâ€™ death, while unusual for ancient biography, aligns with their **religious purpose** and reflects their **sub-subgenre** as _Christian religious biographies_.

Understanding the Gospels within this genre framework helps modern readers appreciate how they were written, heard, and understood in the ancient worldâ€”not just as historical records, but as **moral and theological portraits** meant to **inspire belief and imitation**.
