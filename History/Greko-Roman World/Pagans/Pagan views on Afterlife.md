[[Pagan religions in GRW]]
In contrast to many modern religions, **most ancient people did not believe in a clear or rewarding afterlife**. Studies of ancient gravestone inscriptions show that while some believed in a vague, shadowy existence after death, the majority either did not or feared it as a netherworld to be delayed as long as possible.

Religion in antiquity was primarily about **securing and improving life in the present**, not guaranteeing happiness after death. Life was harsh and precarious: no modern medicine or anesthesia, high risks in childbirth, frequent famines and droughts, limited food distribution, constant threats from war, disease, and poverty. Personal anxieties and loss were also ever-present.

Thus, religion functioned as a **practical means to cope with the dangers and uncertainties of daily life**—to seek divine favor for health, safety, and prosperity here and now, rather than for eternal salvation.

Salvation in paganism, according to **Yehezkel [[Kaufman]]**, was often understood as **circumventing the gods** or **accessing hidden knowledge (gnosis)** to tap into the **metadivine realm**—a level of power beyond the gods themselves. Through ritual, magic, or secret wisdom, one could manipulate these cosmic forces to gain control or liberation.
