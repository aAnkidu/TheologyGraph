[[Pagan religions in GRW]]

Many **local gods** were tied to specific places or families but, through **conquest and Hellenization**, some spread widely and merged with Greek or Roman gods (e.g., _Zeus_ = _Jupiter_). **Hellenization** unified religious practices by spreading the **Greek language, myths, and religious forms** across cultures.

The divine realm was imagined as a **hierarchy**:

- At the **top** was the **supreme god** (e.g., _Zeus_, _Jupiter_), often unknowable and distant.
- Below were the **major gods** worshipped throughout the empire (_Poseidon_, _Hera_, _Aphrodite_, _Artemis_, _Dionysus_).
- Next tier included **lesser gods** and **daimonia**—spiritual beings needing ritual appeasement, neither fully good nor evil.
- At the base were **local deities** connected to families and places, including household gods such as **Penates**, **Lares**, and personal spirits called **Genius** in Roman tradition.

- Additionally, some humans were **divinized** after death or believed to be **[[Demigods]]**—born from a union of god and mortal—such as philosophers (Pythagoras), heroes (Heracles), and rulers (Alexander the Great). These figures bridged mortals and gods by virtue of their extraordinary deeds.

Religion and state were deeply intertwined; since gods empowered the state, the state sponsored their worship. Thus, there was **no separation of church and state** in the Greco-Roman world.

### Pagans who heard stories about Jesus and his miracles would have had no difficulty understanding what they meant. Among other things they meant that Jesus was himself divine, a divine man come to earth.
