**Demigod = half-god, half-human figure with special powers or status.**

A **demigod** is traditionally defined as:

- Demigods usually possess **supernatural powers or extraordinary abilities** beyond ordinary humans.
- In mythology, demigods often serve as **heroes or important figures** who bridge the human and divine worlds.
- Examples include **Heracles (Hercules)** in Greek mythology and **Aeneas** in Roman myth.
