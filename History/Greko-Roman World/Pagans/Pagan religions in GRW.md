[[Greco-Roman World]]

Unlike Judaism, **pagan religions** in the Roman Empire had **no central authority**, **no creeds**, and **no sacred texts** guiding belief or behavior. Religious practice was mainly **ritual-based**, not focused on ethics, doctrines, or afterlife beliefs. There was **no exclusivity**â€”people worshiped many gods simultaneously, often adding new deities rather than replacing old ones.
