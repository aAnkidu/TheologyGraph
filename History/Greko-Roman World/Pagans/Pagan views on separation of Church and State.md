[[Pagan religions in GRW]]
In the Greco-Roman world, there was **no separation between religion and the state**. Both served a shared purpose: to secure **peace, prosperity, and public order**. The gods were believed to support the success of the state, and in return, the state **actively promoted their worship**.

**Priesthoods** were essentially **political positions**. Roman priests came from the **senatorial class** and held office as part of the public religious system. **Temples** were built to commemorate **military victories**, staffed by public officials, and **funded by the government**. Religious festivals were organized and overseen by the state.

The **emperor** himself became a religious figure. Initially, Roman emperors were **divinized after death** by a Senate declaration. However, outside of Rome, even **living emperors were worshipped** during the New Testament period as divine figures or **“Saviors” of the empire**. This **imperial cult** reinforced political loyalty through religious devotion.

This tight integration of politics and religion was central to Roman identity and helped **legitimize imperial power**. Refusal to participate in public cults, including emperor worship, was seen not just as impiety, but as **a political threat**.
