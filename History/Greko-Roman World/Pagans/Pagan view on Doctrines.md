[[Pagan religions in GRW]]
But how could the powerful and immortal gods be influenced to provide what was needed in this life? The gods were not impressed by anyone’s beliefs about them nor did they require people to say the proper creed or acknowledge the proper “truths.”

What mattered was not what people thought about the gods, but **how they honored them through cultic acts**. Religion was centered on **ritual**, not creed.

The term **“cult”** (from Latin _cultus_) meant **“care for the gods”**, similar to how _agriculture_ means “care of the fields.” Worship involved regular acts like **prayer**, **sacrifice**, **festivals**, and **ritual offerings**, usually done at home or through community ceremonies.

Paganism was not one-sided; gods also **communicated their will to humans** through **divination**. Roman priests known as **augurs** practiced **auspicy**—interpreting **bird behavior**, **animal entrails** (_extispicy_), or other signs to determine divine approval or disapproval, especially for public actions like war.

According to **[[Kaufman]]**, such practices reflect the **non-moral, transactional nature of pagan religion**. The divine realm was not personal or ethical but **mechanical and ritualized**. Through **divination**, humans could **access divine knowledge embedded in the natural world**, allowing them to **navigate divine favor without needing revelation or obedience**. This aligns with the broader pagan view of the world as **subject to manipulable cosmic forces**, rather than governed by a sovereign, personal God.
