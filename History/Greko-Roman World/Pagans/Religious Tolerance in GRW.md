[[Pagan religions in GRW]]
Because of the **persecution of early Christians**, many today assume the Roman Empire was **intolerant of religious diversity**. In reality, **basic tolerance** was a core feature of Greco-Roman religion. Religious practices were broadly accepted as long as **they did not threaten public order or state loyalty**.

Refusing to offer **sacrifice to the gods or to the emperor’s genius** was not seen as private religious dissent but as a **political act of defiance**, similar to rejecting the legitimacy of the state itself. Since **many gods were believed to exist**, and all were thought to deserve worship, **refusal to participate in public cults** seemed socially and politically irrational.

The Greco-Roman world viewed religion **more like social affiliation**—you could worship the gods of your own city, and also those of any new place you visited or moved to. People were expected to **adapt to local cults** without abandoning their original gods. Religion was **non-exclusive**: worshipping one god did **not preclude worshipping others**.

There was **no concept that one set of gods was uniquely true**, nor that others must be rejected. **Conversion** was not expected, and religious rites were largely **tolerated and localized**. Worshippers of state gods did not attempt to eliminate or discredit other cults.

This openness sharply contrasts with **later Christian exclusivism**, which held that **only one God was true**, and that **other gods were false**—an idea foreign to the religious environment in which Christianity first emerged.
