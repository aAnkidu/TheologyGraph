**Philosophy and religion served different roles** in the [[Greco-Roman World]]. Religion aimed to **honor the gods** and **secure well-being through ritual**, while **philosophy focused on personal well-being** in a difficult and unstable world.

All major philosophical schools (e.g. **[[Stoicism]]**, **[[Epicureanism]]**, [[Platonism]]) taught that **inner peace** came from **living in harmony with nature**, though they defined this differently—**Stoics** saw it as accepting the divine order of the world, while **Epicureans** believed the gods were distant and peace came from enjoying simple pleasures.

Unlike religion, **philosophy was often intolerant**—if one philosophy was right, others were wrong. Philosophers **argued, debated, and tried to convert others**, making philosophy more **missionary-like** than the pluralistic religious cults.

Still, philosophy and religion were not in conflict; many philosophers were also priests, but the two belonged to **distinct spheres**: one focused on **divine favor**, the other on **personal meaning and well-being**.
