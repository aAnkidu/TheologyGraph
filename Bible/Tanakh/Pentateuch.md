[[Hebrew Bible]]
The **Pentateuch** (from Greek _penta teuchos_, “five scrolls”) refers to the **first five books** of the Hebrew Bible (and Christian Old Testament):  
**Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy**.

In Jewish tradition, these books are known collectively as the **[[Torah]]**, meaning “law” or “instruction.” They are considered the **core of God’s covenant** with Israel and contain:
- **Creation and early history** (Genesis)
- **The story of the patriarchs** (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob)
- **The Exodus from Egypt** and **reception of the Law at Sinai** (Exodus–Deuteronomy)
- Detailed **legal, ritual, and moral instructions**
