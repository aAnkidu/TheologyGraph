## Jewish tradition

### First Century "sons of God"

Jesus was not the only Jewish figure in the first century believed to be a **miracle-working “Son of God.”** Within Jewish tradition, others were also revered as righteous men with divine favor who could **heal the sick, control nature, and defeat demons** through prayer and spiritual power.

Two notable figures are:

- **Honi the Circle-Drawer** (1st century B.C.E.): A Galilean teacher famous for **praying for rain** by drawing a circle around himself and refusing to leave until God answered his prayer. He was **revered as a miracle-worker**, and some later traditions refer to him as a **Son of God**. Like Jesus, he was **martyred outside Jerusalem near Passover**, and his death was believed to have provoked divine punishment on his killers.
- **Hanina ben Dosa** (1st century C.E.): A Galilean rabbi shortly after Jesus’ time, known for **healing, exorcism, and control over nature**. He was deeply **righteous** and believed to be especially close to God. A heavenly voice was said to have called him **Son of God**, much like the Gospel accounts of Jesus.

Although different in their methods (e.g. **miracles through prayer**, not personal authority), these figures show that the **concept of a righteous Jewish miracle-worker called “Son of God” was not unique** to Jesus. Such titles and acts would have been **intelligible and culturally familiar** to Jewish audiences of the time.

### Earlier traditions

The notion that mere mortals could have such a relationship was itself quite ancient, as shown by the Jewish Scriptures themselves, where an individual was sometimes called “the son of God.” The king of Israel, for example, was thought to mediate between God and humans and so stand in a special relationship with God as a child does to a parent. Even kings with dubious public records were sometimes called “the son of God” (e.g., 2 Sam 7:14; Ps 2:7–9).

**2 Samuel 7:14**  
> "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will punish him with a rod such as mortals use, with blows inflicted by human beings."

**Psalm 2:7–9**  
> 7 "I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, 'You are my son; today I have begotten you.  
> 8 Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.  
> 9 You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.'"

### Pagan tradition

In the Greco-Roman world, the title **“Son of God”** was not unique to any one figure but was used in various contexts to denote special divine status or favor. Common uses included:

- **[[Demigods]]**: Legendary heroes or extraordinary humans born from the union of a god and a mortal, such as **Heracles** or **Alexander the Great**, were considered “sons of gods” because of their divine parentage and remarkable deeds.
    
- **Roman Emperors**: Emperors like **Augustus** were officially titled _Divi filius_ (“Son of the Divine”) after their deified predecessors, signaling their semi-divine authority and legitimizing imperial power.
    
- **Mythic and Religious Figures**: Various gods’ offspring or favored mortals, including figures like **Dionysus** and **Aeneas**, were described as “sons of gods,” reinforcing their special role as intermediaries between mortals and the divine.
    
- **Philosophers and Sages** (less commonly): Some revered individuals were metaphorically called “sons of God” to indicate their spiritual wisdom or closeness to divine knowledge.
    

Thus, in pagan traditions, “Son of God” generally indicated a person of extraordinary divine connection, whether through birth, status, or favor, and often served to legitimize authority or heroic status.
