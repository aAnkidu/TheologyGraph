Jesus was not the only Jewish figure in the first century believed to be a **miracle-working “Son of God.”** Within Jewish tradition, others were also revered as righteous men with divine favor who could **heal the sick, control nature, and defeat demons** through prayer and spiritual power.

Two notable figures are:

- **Honi the Circle-Drawer** (1st century B.C.E.): A Galilean teacher famous for **praying for rain** by drawing a circle around himself and refusing to leave until God answered his prayer. He was **revered as a miracle-worker**, and some later traditions refer to him as a **Son of God**. Like Jesus, he was **martyred outside Jerusalem near Passover**, and his death was believed to have provoked divine punishment on his killers.
- **Hanina ben Dosa** (1st century C.E.): A Galilean rabbi shortly after Jesus’ time, known for **healing, exorcism, and control over nature**. He was deeply **righteous** and believed to be especially close to God. A heavenly voice was said to have called him **Son of God**, much like the Gospel accounts of Jesus.

Although different in their methods (e.g. **miracles through prayer**, not personal authority), these figures show that the **concept of a righteous Jewish miracle-worker called “Son of God” was not unique** to Jesus. Such titles and acts would have been **intelligible and culturally familiar** to Jewish audiences of the time.
