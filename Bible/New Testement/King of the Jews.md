The title **“King of the Jews”** appears mostly in **Roman or outsider contexts**, especially in the **New Testament**. It is used during Jesus’ **trial and crucifixion** (e.g. Mark 15:2, John 19:19), and likely served as a **political accusation**—suggesting that Jesus claimed to rule the Jewish people, which would have been seen as a **threat to Roman authority**.

This phrase is different from **“Jewish king”**, which is a more **internal, ethnic-religious term** used to describe **a king from among the Jewish people**, like **[[👑 David]] or [[👑 Hezekiah]]**, who ruled with traditional legitimacy.

➡️ Unlike “[[Jewish King]]” which focuses on **identity and heritage**, the title “King of the Jews” often had **external and political overtones**, especially under [[🏛️ Roman Rule]].

➡️ **[[👑 Herod the Great]]** was officially given the title **“King of the Jews”** by the **Roman Senate** in 40 B.C.E. and ruled from **37 to 4 B.C.E.**. Although he held the title, many Jews **did not see him as a true Jewish king**, since he was **Idumean** (not from the line of David) and closely tied to **Roman power**.
