Proto-orthodox Christians agreed with the
[[Jewish-Christian Adoptionists]] who said that Jesus was fully
human, but disagreed when these people
denied that he was divine. They agreed with
the [[Marcionite Christians]] who said that Jesus was fully
divine, but disagreed when they denied that he
was human. They agreed with the [[Gnostic Christians]]
who said that Jesus Christ taught the way of
salvation, but disagreed when they said that
he was two beings rather than one and when
they claimed that his true teachings had been
secret, accessible only to the elect few. In
short, proto-orthodox Christians argued that
Jesus Christ was both ==divine and human==, that he
was one being instead of two, and that he had
taught his disciples the truth. They claimed that
the apostles had written the teachings of Jesus
down and that, when interpreted in a straightfor-
ward and literal fashion, the books that were
passed on from the apostles to their followers
revealed the truth necessary for salvation.

Because the proto-orthodox group represented
the party that eventually became dominant in
Christianity ==(by at least the fourth century)==,
Christians of all later generations inherited their
canon of Scripture, rather than the canons sup-
ported by their opponents.
