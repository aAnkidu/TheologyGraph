[[Early Christian movements]]
According to these Christians, this one God
chose Israel and gave it his Law (in the Jewish
Scriptures). Furthermore, Jesus taught that his fol-
lowers must continue to **==obey the entire Law==**
(except the law that required animal sacrifice) in
all its detailsâ€”and not just the Ten Command-
ments! Those who were not born Jews must first
become Jews in order to follow Jesus. For men,
this meant being circumcised; for men and
women, it meant observing the sabbath and keep-
ing kosher food laws.
On what grounds did these Christians advance
this understanding of the faith? They had a sacred
book written in Hebrew which they claimed con-
tained the teachings of Jesus himself, a book that
was similar to what we today know as the **==Gospel**==
==**of Matthew==** (without the first two chapters).
What about the other books of the New
Testament, the other Gospels and Acts, the epis-
tles, and Revelation? Odd as it might seem, these
Jewish Christians had never heard of some of these
books, and rejected others of them outright. In
particular, they considered Paul, one of the most
prominent authors of our New Testament, to be an
arch-heretic rather than an apostle. Since, in
their opinion, Paul blasphemously taught that
Christ brought an end to the Jewish Law, his writ-
ings were to be rejected as heretical. In short,
these second-century Christians did not have our
New Testament canon (see box 1.1).
