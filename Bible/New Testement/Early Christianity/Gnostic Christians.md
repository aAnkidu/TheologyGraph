[[Early Christian movements]]
Gnostics, so named because of their claim that special “gnosis” (Greek for “knowledge”) is necessary for salvation.

Some Gnostics agreed with [[Marcionite Christians]] that Jesus was totally divine and not at all human, and for much the same reason that he did: Jesus represented a different God from the one who created this world.

Others, however, claimed that Jesus Christ represented two distinct beings, the
human Jesus and the divine Christ.

These Gnostics agreed with the [[Jewish-Christian Adoptionists]] that Jesus was the most righteous man on earth and that something special had happened at his baptism.

They did not think, though, that God adopted him to be his son as [[Jewish-Christian Adoptionists]]; instead, they maintained that his baptism was the moment at which the divine being, the Christ, came into the man Jesus, empowering him for his healing and, especially, teaching ministry.

At the end of Jesus’ life, immediately before his death, the Christ then departed from him once again to return to heaven. This is why Jesus cried out in such anguish on the cross, “My God, my God, why have you left me behind?” (cf. Mark 15:34).

Unlike the [[Jewish-Christian Adoptionists]] who were strict monotheists (believing in only one God) or the [[Marcionite Christians]] who were strict ditheists (believing in two), Gnostics were ==polytheists== (believing in many).

Gnostics felt a sense of alienation from this world and knew that they did not belong here. They were spiritual beings from the divine realm who had become entrapped in the realm of matter by the evil God and his subordinates. Salvation meant escaping from this material world. Thus a god from the divine realm entered into the man Jesus, and left him prior to his death, so that he could impart to the imprisoned spirits the knowledge (gnosis!) that is necessary for escape.
