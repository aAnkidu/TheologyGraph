[[Early Christian movements]]
For Marcion and his followers, the differences
between the religion preached by Jesus (and his
apostle, Paul) and that found in the Jewish
Scriptures were plain to see. Whereas the Jewish
God punishes those who disobey, they claimed, the
God of Jesus extends mercy and forgiveness; where-
as the God of the Jews says “an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth,” the God of Jesus says to “turn the
other cheek”; and whereas the Old Testament God
tells the Israelites to conquer Jericho by slaughter-
ing its entire population—men, women, and chil-
dren—the God of Jesus says to love your enemies.
What do these two Gods have in common?
According to the Marcionites, nothing.

### For them, there are two separate and unrelated Gods, the God of the Jews and the God of Jesus.

Marcionite Christians maintained that Jesus
did not belong to the wrathful and just God of the
Jews, the God who created the world and chose
Israel to be his special people. In fact,
### Jesus came to save people from this God.

Moreover, since
Jesus had no part in the Creator, he could have
no real ties to the material world that the
Creator-God made. Jesus therefore was not actu-
ally born and did not have a real flesh-and-blood
body. How, then, did Jesus get hungry and thirsty,
how did he bleed and die? According to Marcionites, it was all an appearance: Jesus only
seemed to be human. As the one true God him-
self, come to earth to deliver people from the
vengeful God of the Jews, Jesus was never born,
never got hungry or thirsty or tired, never bled or
died. 
### Jesus’ body was a phantasm.

It is interesting to reflect on how our present New Testament emerged from this conflict, for, in fact, the first person to establish a fixed canon of Scripture appears to have been none other than Marcion. Marcion’s insistence that his sacred books (a form of Luke and ten truncated letters of Paul) made up the Christian Bible evidently led other Christians to affirm a larger canon, which included other Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and John) and other
epistles (the “Pastoral” epistles—1 and 2 Timothy
and Titus—and the eight general epistles) as well
as the books of Acts and Revelation.
