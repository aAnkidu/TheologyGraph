[[Forms of Early Judaism]]
Josephus refers to a group of Jews as the **“fourth philosophy”** to distinguish them from the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. This faction included several groups who supported the use of **armed rebellion** to overthrow the foreign rulers of Judea, particularly the Romans.

They believed that the land was rightfully theirs by divine grant, and that God desired them to reclaim it through force. Their commitment to violent resistance ultimately led to the **Jewish War of 66 C.E.**, about 35 years after Jesus’ death. This conflict resulted in devastating consequences: a massive loss of Jewish life, the destruction of the Temple, and the razing of Jerusalem.
