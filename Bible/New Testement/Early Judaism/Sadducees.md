[[Forms of Early Judaism]]

(roughly 200 BCE to 70 CE)

The **Sadducees** were an aristocratic group of Jews, known for their **wealth, high social standing**, and **strong political connections**. Unlike the Pharisees, they **rejected the oral law** and held strictly to the **written Law of Moses**, particularly as found in the **Torah**.

They emphasized the **proper worship of God in the Jerusalem Temple**, which they saw as central to Jewish life and religious practice. ==Most of the **chief priests** responsible for overseeing the Temple and its sacrifices appear to have been **aligned with the Sadducees**==.

The Sadducees also held distinct **theological positions**. For example, they **denied belief in the [[Resurrection of the dead]]**, a point of sharp disagreement with the Pharisees.

As members of the **Jerusalem elite**, the Sadducees maintained **close ties to Roman authorities**. The **high priest**, typically from their ranks, acted as the **liaison between the Jewish population and the Roman governor**, giving the Sadducees considerable influence in both religious and political affairs.
