The belief in the **resurrection of the dead** is the idea that after death, the dead will be raised back to life in some future time. This concept was not universally accepted in ancient Judaism and was a subject of debate among different Jewish groups.

Many Jews who held this belief expected a future bodily resurrection, often associated with the coming of Godâ€™s kingdom or final judgment. The resurrection was seen as a hope for vindication, reward, and eternal life beyond death, especially for the righteous.

However, not all Jewish sects accepted this idea. Some groups, like the Sadducees, denied any form of resurrection, focusing instead on rewards and punishments in this present life or denying any afterlife altogether.
