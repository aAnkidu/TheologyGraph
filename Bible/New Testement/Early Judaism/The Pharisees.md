[[Forms of Early Judaism]]
The **Pharisees** were widely respected as sincere and pious Jews who aimed above all to **keep the Law of Moses** as faithfully as possible. Later Christian critiques that portray them as hypocrites misrepresent their true goals; joining the Pharisees did not require insincerity but rather a deep commitment to **living in obedience to God’s commandments**.

One of the Pharisees' main concerns was how to interpret laws that were **not clearly defined in Scripture**. For example, the Law forbade work on the Sabbath, but did not specify what "work" meant. The Pharisees debated such questions and developed **oral traditions** that explained how the written laws were to be applied in daily life.

In the Pharisees’ view, following these **oral laws** was necessary in order to fully keep the **written Law**. Their detailed approach to religious life and their dedication to the Law earned them **respect** among many Jews for their **rigorous piety**.

The **Pharisees** were among the Jewish groups who strongly believed in the **[[Resurrection of the dead]]**. This belief distinguished them sharply from the Sadducees, who rejected it.
