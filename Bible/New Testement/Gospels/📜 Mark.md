[[ðŸ“œ Gospels]]

When Jesus was proclaimed the [["Son of God"]] (by God himself no less), most readers in the Greco-Roman world would probably have taken this to mean that he was like other sons of God â€”divinely inspired teachers or rulers whose miraculous deeds benefitted the human race.  But given the ==Jewishness of the rest of the beginning==, perhaps we should inquire what a Jewish reader would make of the title Son of God.

 *More detailed information on Pagan and Jewish tradition:* [["Son of God"]] 

This portrayal of Jesus as an ==authoritative Son of God== sets the stage for the rest of the Gospel.

Given the incredible following that Jesus amasses, the amazing teachings that he delivers, and the miraculous deeds that he performs, one would think that he would become immediately and widely acknowledged for who he is, a man **specially endowed by God**, the Son of God who provides divine assistance for those in need.

Ironically, as the careful reader of the Gospel begins to realize, nothing of the sort is destined to happen. Jesus, this authoritative [["Son of God"]], is ==almost universally **misunderstood** by those with whom he comes in closest contact==.

Even worse, despite his clear concern to help others and to deliver the good news of God, he becomes **opposed** by the religious leaders of his people.

Both of these characteristics are major aspects of **Markâ€™s portrayal of Jesus**:  
==He is the **opposed** and **misunderstood Son of God**==.
