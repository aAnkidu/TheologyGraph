[[📜 Gospels]]

# Problematic of Matthew:
### 1.  Jesus the ==Jewish== messiah in fulfillment of the ==Jewish== Scriptures

> Thus Matthew begins his Gospel by indicating that Jesus was a Jew (from Abraham) in the line of the ancient kings (from David). One is immediately impressed by a distinctive feature of this narrative: Jesus is portrayed as thoroughly and ineluctably Jewish. He was Jewish in Mark’s Gospel as well, of course; but here the emphasis is yet stronger. Matthew’s narrative will show that Jesus was the ultimate fulfillment of the hopes of the Jews.

### 2. ✨ **Fulfillment Citations**

Matthew frequently uses "fulfillment citations" with formulaic expressions such as:

> This occurred in order to fulfill what was spoken of by the prophet.

==These are unique to Matthew== and appear eleven times throughout the Gospel. Every major event is said to fulfill prophecy—not only in the birth narrative, but also in later episodes throughout Jesus’ life and ministry.

> Indeed, so does every other event in the narrative: Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem (2:6), the family’s flight to Egypt (2:14), Herod’s slaughter of the innocent children of Bethlehem (2:18), and the family’s decision to relocate in Nazareth (2:23).

🔍 **Two Ways Jesus Fulfills Scripture**

1. **Direct Prediction**: The prophets predicted future events about the messiah, and Matthew sees Jesus fulfilling them literally.
2. **Foreshadowing and Typology**: Events in Jewish history are seen as symbolic anticipations of Jesus. Their full meaning is realized only in him ([[Jesus as the New Moses]])

> The meaning of these ancient events was not complete until that which was foreshadowed came into existence. When it did, the event was "fulfilled," that is, "filled full of meaning."
### 3. **Conflict with Jewish Leaders**

A notable redaction from Mark([[Redaction criticism]]) is how Matthew portrays the Pharisees and Sadducees, already in the baptism scene:

> You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit worthy of repentance. Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the tree; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. (3:7–10)

This harsh attack is unique to Matthew and reflects his broader theme: ==contrast between Jesus and the Jewish leaders.==

Matthew downplays Mark’s “messianic secret.” Throughout the Gospel, Jesus is openly recognized as the Son of God, and worshipped as such—even by his disciples.

> And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, ‘Truly you are the Son of God’ (14:33).

By making Jesus’ identity public and obvious, Matthew increases the culpability of the Jewish authorities who reject him. Their failure to accept him becomes more than a misunderstanding—it becomes a willful rejection of clear divine revelation.

### 4. 🔥 **[[Apocalypticism]] and Judgment**

Matthew also enhances the apocalyptic tone of John the Baptist’s preaching by drawing from the [[Q Source]]:

> Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees… every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

Being Jewish alone is not enough:

> Do not presume to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’… God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

Preparation for the end requires a righteous life:

> Bear fruit worthy of repentance.

These redactional emphases show Matthew's urgent warning of coming judgment and stress that Jesus was not only known but rejected—deliberately—by the Jewish leaders.
