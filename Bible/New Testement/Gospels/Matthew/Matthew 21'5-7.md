Some scholars have come to doubt that Matthew was a Jew despite the heavy emphasis
on Jesus’ own Jewishness in this Gospel. One of the more intriguing pieces of evidence that
is sometimes cited involves Matthew’s interpretation of passages drawn from the Hebrew
Bible, especially Zechariah 9:9, as quoted in Matthew 21:5: “Look your king is coming to
you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”
Anyone who has studied the Jewish Scriptures extensively recognizes the literary form of
this passage. Throughout the Psalms and other books of poetry, Hebrew authors employed a
kind of parallelism in which a second line of a couplet simply repeated the ideas of the first
line using different words. Here the parallelism is between the “donkey” of the first line and
the “colt, the foal of a donkey” in the second.
Matthew, however, appears to have misunderstood the parallelism, or at least to have
understood it in a highly unusual way. For he seems to have thought that the prophet was
speaking of two different animals, one of them a donkey and the other a colt. So, when Jesus
prepares to ride into Jerusalem, his followers actually acquire two animals for him, which he
straddles for the trip into town (21:5–7; contrast Mark 11:7)! Some scholars have argued
that no educated Jew would have made this kind of mistake about the Zechariah passage
(none of the other Gospel writers, it might be pointed out, does so), so this author could not
have been Jewish.
Most other scholars, however, have not been convinced, in part because we know all sorts
of educated authors from the ancient world (as well as the modern one) who seem to misread
texts that derive from their own contexts. This includes ancient Jewish interpreters of their
own Hebrew Scriptures, some of whom produce interpretations that are no more bizarre than
Matthew’s interpretation of Zechariah (including some late rabbinic sources, which also indi-
cate that Zechariah was referring to two animals!). On these grounds, at least, the identity of
Matthew has to be left as an open question.
