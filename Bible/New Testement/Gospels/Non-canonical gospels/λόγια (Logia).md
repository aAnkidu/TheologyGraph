Logion (Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¹Î¿Î½) is a ==Greek word that primarily refers to a saying or pronouncement, especially one attributed to Jesus or of divine origin==. In biblical scholarship

The term _**logia**_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¹Î±), plural of _**logion**_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¹Î¿Î½), is used variously in ancient writings and modern scholarship in reference to communications of divine origin.

ince the 19th century, New Testament scholarship has tended to reserve the term _logion_ for a divine saying, especially one spoken by Jesus, in contrast to narrative, and to call a collection of such sayings, as exemplified by the [[ðŸ“œ Thomas]], _logia_.
