[[ðŸ“œ Mark]]

38Â And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.

---

At the moment of Jesusâ€™ death (Mark 15:38), the curtain of the Temple is torn in twoâ€”from top to bottom. This curtain separated the Holy of Holies, the innermost and most sacred part of the Temple, where God's presence was believed to dwell, from the rest of the Temple.

Only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), to offer sacrifices for the people's sins.

The tearing of the curtain symbolizes that through Jesusâ€™ death, direct access to God is now possible for all people. It marks the end of the old sacrificial system and priestly mediation, emphasizing that Jesusâ€™ sacrifice is the ultimate atonement.

The fact that the curtain was torn from top to bottom (and not bottom to top) suggests this was an act of God rather than humans, highlighting divine initiative in opening the way to God.
