 **Passion narrative = story of Jesus’ suffering and death**

The **Passion narrative** is the part of the Gospel that describes the events leading up to and including the suffering, crucifixion, death, and burial of Jesus Christ. It typically covers Jesus’ arrest, trial, condemnation, physical suffering, and execution.

The term **"Passion"** comes from the Latin word _passio_, meaning **“suffering”** or **“enduring.”** It emphasizes the intense physical and emotional suffering that Jesus endured during this final phase of his life. The Passion narrative highlights Jesus’ role as the suffering servant and the sacrificial figure who dies for the salvation of humanity.
