[[ðŸ“œ Gospels]]

Before the Gospels were written, **stories about Jesus were passed on by word of mouth**, spreading across **major urban areas of the Mediterranean**. These opportunities to tell stories must have presented themselves **for decades prior to the writing of the Gospels**, as otherwise there would be no way to account for the spread of the religion in a world without modern communication.

We do not know exactly what early Christian leaders told new converts, but we can imagine they shared **the essentials of the faith**: the one true God, his creation, and his son Jesusâ€”**who he was, how he came into the world, what he taught, what he did, why he suffered, and how he died**. These stories were used to **win new believers** and to **edify those already converted**. They were told in **evangelism, instruction**, and likely during **worship gatherings**.

Because the Gospels had not yet been written, **these stories had to be passed on orally**. But who told them? Not every story could have come from the apostles. "The mission goes on for years and years and years all over the map." Nor were most told by eyewitnesses. Rather, they were recounted by people **who had heard them from others**, who had **also not seen the events themselves**. These stories were told in **Egypt, Judea, Galilee, Syria, Cilicia, Asia Minor, Macedonia, Achaia, Italy, and Spain**â€”in **different languages**, primarily **Greek**, not Jesusâ€™s native **Aramaic**, and often by people **who were not Jews** and had **never met an eyewitness**.

A hypothetical example illustrates how the process may have worked: a **Greek-speaking worshipper of Artemis in Ephesus** hears about Jesus from a stranger, is impressed by stories of **his miracles and teachings**, and converts after witnessing an act of healing. He is **baptized and joins the local Christian community**, and later, during a **business trip to Smyrna**, he shares what he has learned with others. Some also convert, begin to **gather for worship**, and retell the same stories. They convert others, and those people spread the word further. And so it goesâ€”**the religion grows**, passed on through stories, **mostly by those who had never seen an eyewitness, or even met someone who had**.

We also have reason to think that early Christians were not particularly concerned that stories about Jesus were being changed. Odd as it may seem to us, most believers appear to have been less concerned than we are about what we would call the facts of history.
