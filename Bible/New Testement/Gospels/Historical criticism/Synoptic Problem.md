[[üìú Synoptic Gospels]]

The **Synoptic Problem** is the scholarly term for the challenge of explaining the **literary relationships** among the Gospels of **Matthew**, **Mark**, and **Luke**‚Äîcalled the **[[üìú Synoptic Gospels]]** because they can be "seen together" (from _syn_ = together, _optic_ = seeing) due to their overlapping content, structure, and wording.

This overlap is **virtually inexplicable** unless the Gospels are **literarily related**‚Äîmeaning they used **common written sources**.

> If you compare three modern newspapers covering the same event, each will report it with unique wording‚Äîexcept where they quote a **shared source** like the Associated Press. If two reports match word-for-word, it's almost certain they copied from a common source. The same logic applies to the Synoptic Gospels.

#### Patterns of agreement and disagreement

- Some stories appear in **all three Gospels**.
- Some appear in **only two** (e.g., Matthew and Luke).
- Others are **unique to one Gospel**.
- Even when telling the **same story**, sometimes all three use **identical phrasing**, sometimes they **diverge** in wording or detail.
- In some cases, **two agree against the third**.

This complex mixture of **agreement and variation** makes it clear that the Gospels are **interdependent**, but also **individual literary compositions**. The question is: **How did this happen?**

#### Why it matters

The Synoptic Problem is not simply a puzzle about literary borrowing. Solving it helps scholars:

- trace the **historical development** of early Christian tradition
- identify the **distinctive theological agendas** of each evangelist
- better understand how the **Jesus tradition** was shaped and transmitted    

The most widely accepted solution among scholars is the **[[Four-Source Hypothesis]]**.
The cornerstone of this hypothesis is the theo-
ry that Matthew and Luke both used Mark. We
therefore begin our discussion by considering the
arguments that scholars have generally found to be
persuasive of ‚ÄúMarkan priority.‚Äù
