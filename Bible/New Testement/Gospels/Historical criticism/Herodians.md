[[Forms of Early Judaism]]

The Herodians were a group of Jews that Mark mentions but does not identify (3:6; 12:13; see also Matt 22:16). They are described in no other ancient source except [[ðŸ“œ Gospel of Mark]]. Mark may understand them to be collaborationists, that is, supporters of the Herods, the rulers intermittently appointed over Jews in Palestine by the Romans.
