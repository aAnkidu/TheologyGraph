The **Four‑Source Hypothesis** is the most widely accepted solution to the **[[Synoptic Problem]]**—it explains how the Gospels of Matthew and Luke relate to earlier materials.  
It proposes that **four distinct written sources** were used:

1. **Mark** – a narrative Gospel shared by both Matthew and Luke
2. **[[Q Source]]** (from German _Quelle_, “source”) – a sayings collection used by Matthew and Luke but not found in Mark
3. **M** – material unique to Matthew
4. **L** – material unique to Luke

According to this hypothesis:

- **Matthew** = Mark + Q + M
- **Luke** = Mark + Q + L

==The cornerstone of this hypothesis is the theory that Matthew and Luke both used Mark The arguments that scholars have generally found to be persuasive of [[Markan Priority]].==
