[[Historical criticism]]

Redaction criticism is the study of how a text has been edited or modified by an author to reveal their particular theological, literary, or ideological emphases. A **redactor** is someone who edits a text, and redaction criticism asks: _Why would an author change a source unless they had a reason?_

In Gospel studies, the method assumes that the Evangelists used written sources—particularly that **Matthew and Luke used Mark** as a primary source. By comparing how they altered Mark’s stories (adding details, omitting content, reordering events), scholars can identify each author’s distinctive concerns and interpretive goals.

If multiple changes in a Gospel point in a consistent direction, this reveals the redactor’s unique theological agenda or the needs of their community.

Redaction criticism helps uncover:

- what each Gospel writer **wanted to emphasize**
- how they shaped inherited tradition for their **own audience**
- the evolving understanding of **Jesus’ identity and mission**
    

This method begins with demonstrating source dependence (e.g. the [[Four-Source Hypothesis]]) and proceeds to analyze how the redactor transformed those sources.
