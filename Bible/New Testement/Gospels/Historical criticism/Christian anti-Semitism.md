===Matthewâ€™s Gospel is widely regarded as the most Jewish of the four Gospels, deeply rooted in Jewish law, customs, and scripture. Because of this strong Jewish context, it is difficult to argue that the author intentionally promoted anti-Semitic ideas. Rather, some passages reflect the complex and often tense relationship between early Christian communities and their Jewish roots. The note addresses how certain interpretations of Matthewâ€™s text have historically been used to justify Christian anti-Semitism, but this should not obscure the Gospelâ€™s fundamentally Jewish character or the diversity of its meanings.===


[[ðŸ“œ Matthew]] was the source of some of the worst Christian anti-Semitism, by portraying Jesus as rejecting the Law of Moses, ==in some Christian interpretations==, and substituting his own law.

Most prominently, the idea that [[Pharisees]] are hypocrites comes from Matthew, implying

> that Jews are legalistic and we, Christians, are full of grace and truth.

> So this idea that the Old Testament represents a God of anger and a God of strictness and a God of judgement; and a New Testament  represents a God who is father and loving and full of grace

Historically, especially during the medieval period, certain passages from Matthewâ€™s Gospel were interpreted or misused to justify widespread Christian anti-Semitism. Medieval Christian societies often portrayed Jews negatively, fueled in part by these interpretations. This led to social exclusion, discrimination, and violent persecution of Jewish communities throughout Europe. It is important to recognize that these historical developments arose from interpretations long after the Gospelâ€™s composition and do not necessarily reflect the original intentions of the author.
