[[Four-Source Hypothesis]]

The **Markan Priority** hypothesis proposes that the **Gospel of [[📜 Mark]] was the first of the Synoptic Gospels to be written**, and that **both Matthew and Luke used Mark as a written source** for their own accounts of Jesus’ life.

Markan Priority forms the foundation of the **Two-Source Hypothesis** and **[[Four-Source Hypothesis]]**, both of which build on the idea that **Mark is the earliest Gospel**.

Most New Testament scholars today accept Markan Priority as the most plausible explanation for [[Synoptic Problem]].

#### 🧩 **Patterns of agreement**
#reserch_topic 

==Because verbatim agreements are the main reason to suspect a shared source, examining the nature of these agreements helps determine the direction of literary dependence.==

- Sometimes **all three Gospels agree word-for-word** — this happens when **both Matthew and Luke copied Mark directly without changes**.
    
- Sometimes **all three Gospels differ** — this reflects when **Matthew and Luke each made different changes to Mark’s account**.
    
- Sometimes **two Gospels agree, and one differs**:
    
    - **Matthew and Mark agree against Luke** in some stories.
        
    - **Mark and Luke agree against Matthew** in others.
        
    - But it is **rare for Matthew and Luke to agree against Mark** in wording.
        

> “If Matthew were the source for Mark and Luke, or if Luke were the source for Matthew and Mark, you would probably not get this pattern.”

> “The fact that they rarely do differ from Mark while agreeing with one another indicates that Mark must have been their source.”

#### 📝 **Characteristics of the changes**

Mark’s Greek style is often **awkward or less polished**, with unusual words or difficult theological ideas. In parallel stories, Matthew and Luke tend to **smooth out grammar, clarify meaning, or replace awkward phrases**.

> “Sometimes Mark uses a Greek style of writing that is somewhat awkward or not aesthetically pleasing, sometimes he uses unusual words or phrases, and sometimes he presents difficult ideas. In many instances, however, these problems are not found when Matthew or Luke narrates the same stories.”

It is unlikely Mark introduced such problems intentionally, but easy to see why Matthew and Luke would revise and improve Mark’s account.

#### 📏 **Length and Content**

Mark is the shortest Synoptic Gospel, but when Mark and Matthew tell the same story, Mark’s version is often longer and more detailed.

> “In almost every instance that Mark and Matthew tell the same story, Mark’s is longer.”

This indicates Mark was **not abridging Matthew or Luke**, but rather Matthew and Luke added to and edited Mark’s narrative.
