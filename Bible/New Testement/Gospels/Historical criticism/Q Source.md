The **Q source** is a hypothetical written document proposed by scholars to explain the **material shared by [[ðŸ“œ Matthew]] and [[ðŸ“œ Luke]] but not found in Mark**.

Once **[[Markan Priority]]** is established â€” the view that Mark was written first and used by Matthew and Luke â€” it becomes necessary to explain **how Matthew and Luke agree in content and wording** in stories that are **absent from Mark**.

ðŸ“œ What is Q?

The name Q comes from the German word Quelle, meaning source.

Q is defined as the material found in both Matthew and Luke but not in Mark.

It is believed to be a written document, given the verbatim agreements between Matthew and Luke.

It consists mostly of sayings of Jesus, but includes at least two narrative episodes:

- The temptation of Jesus (Matt 4:1â€“11; Luke 4:1â€“13 vs. Mark 1:12â€“13)
    
- The healing of the centurionâ€™s servant (Matt 8:5â€“10; Luke 7:1â€“10)
    

It is indeed striking that almost all of this material comprises sayings of Jesus.

Most scholars think that Q must have been a written document; otherwise it is difficult to explain such long stretches of verbatim agreement between Matthew and Luke.

ðŸ§© Why not Matthew used Luke, or vice versa?

If Luke used Matthew (or the reverse), the non-Markan material would likely follow the same sequence, but it does not.

Instead, these Q-like stories are inserted into different locations in Markâ€™s narrative by both Matthew and Luke.

> Why would an author follow the sequence of one of his sources, except for stories that are not found in his other one?

This suggests that Matthew and Luke used Q independently, placing its material where they felt it fit best.

ðŸ§­ Who preserved Q more accurately?

Luke is often seen as preserving the original order of Q better than Matthew.

Matthew tends to gather and reorganize stories thematically, as seen in his treatment of both Mark and Q:

- Miracle stories grouped into chapters 8â€“9
    
- Teachings like the Beatitudes and Lord's Prayer combined into the Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5â€“6), while in Luke they are separate (Luke 6, 11)
    

If this propensity for reorganizing similar kinds of stories was also at work in his treatment of Q, Lukeâ€™s version is therefore probably closer to the original sequence of the stories in Q.

Among the materials that we can say were found in Q are some of the most memorable
passages in the Gospels, including the following (for simplicity, verse references only from
Luke are given):
- The preaching of John the Baptist (Luke 3:7â€“9, 16â€“17)
- The three temptations in the wilderness (Luke 4:1â€“13)
- The Beatitudes (Luke 6:20â€“23)
- The command to love your enemies (Luke 6:27â€“36)
- The command not to judge others (Luke 6:37â€“42)
- The healing of the centurionâ€™s slave (Luke 7:1â€“10)
- The question from John the Baptist in prison (Luke 7:18â€“35)
- The Lordâ€™s Prayer (Luke 11:2â€“4)
- The need for fearless confession in light of the coming judgment (Luke 12:2â€“12)
- The command not to worry about food and clothing (Luke 12:22â€“32)
- The parable of the unfaithful slave (Luke 12:39â€“48)
- Entering the kingdom through the narrow door (Luke 13:23â€“30)
