[[📜 Mark]]

One way to establish misunderstanding as a Markan theme is to read carefully through the first half of the Gospel and ask, who realizes that Jesus is the Son of God? The answer may come as a bit of a surprise.

Clearly God knows that Jesus is his Son, because he himself declares it at the baptism (1:11). And since this declaration comes directly to Jesus (“You are my beloved Son”), the reader can assume that he knows it as well. In addition, the evil demons recognize Jesus as the Son of God; on several instances they scream it out when they encounter him (3:11, cf.
1:24). Who else knows? Only two other persons: the author of the Gospel, who recounts these various tales, and you the reader.

Through the first half of this Gospel, no one else recognizes Jesus’ identity, including even those who are closest to him. Early on, when he comes to his home town, ==his family tries to snatch him from the public eye because they think that he has gone crazy (Mark 3:21)==.
> 21 When his family heard it, they went out to restrain him, for people were saying, “He has gone out of his mind.”
