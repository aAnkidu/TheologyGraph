[[📜 Mark]]

Mark’s Gospel repeatedly signals that Jesus, though the Christ and Son of God, must suffer and die. After Peter’s confession of Jesus as the [[Messiah]], Jesus explicitly predicts his passion three times: he will be rejected by Jewish leaders, killed, and then raised from the dead ([[Mark 8'31-33]]). ==Despite these predictions, the disciples consistently fail to understand what Jesus means== ([[⚠️🗝️  The Misunderstood Son of God]]).

The first prediction ([[Mark 8'31-33]]) prompts Peter to rebuke Jesus, but Jesus explains that following him requires self-sacrifice, suffering, and taking up the cross rather than seeking power. The second prediction follows the Transfiguration (Mark 9:2–13), yet the disciples remain confused and quarrel over who is greatest. Jesus teaches that true discipleship means humble service.

In the third prediction (Mark 10:33–34), James and John ask for positions of honor, but Jesus reiterates that greatness comes through serving others, just as he came “to serve and to give his life a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45).

The narrative then moves steadily toward Jesus’ death. He enters Jerusalem to acclaim, cleanses the Temple, and confronts opposition from Jewish leaders. He warns of the Temple’s destruction and the imminent coming of the [["Son of Man"]] as a cosmic judge (Mark 13).

The [[Passion narative]] begins with Jesus being anointed (Mark 14:1–9), followed by the Last Supper (14:12–26) and prayer in Gethsemane (14:26–42). Jesus is arrested, tried by the Sanhedrin, accused of blasphemy, and handed over to Pilate (Mark 14:43–65). Peter denies Jesus three times as Jesus predicted (Mark 14:66–72).

When directly asked if he is the Christ, the Son of God, Jesus affirms it, though not as the Jewish authorities expect (Mark 14:61–62). Pilate ultimately condemns Jesus to crucifixion on charges of claiming to be King of the Jews. Jesus is flogged, mocked, beaten, and crucified at 9 a.m. (Mark 15:1–25).

==For Mark, Jesus is the suffering Son of God whose mission involves death and resurrection, redefining the messianic role away from earthly power toward self-sacrificial salvation.==
