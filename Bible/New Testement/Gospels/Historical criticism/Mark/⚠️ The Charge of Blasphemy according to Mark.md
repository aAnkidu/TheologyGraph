[[📜 Gospel of Mark]]

Jesus’ trial before the Jewish Sanhedrin in Mark is both poignant and complex. When the high priest asks Jesus, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” Jesus affirms, “I am; and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven” (14:61–62). The high priest immediately accuses him of blasphemy, and the Sanhedrin agrees.

However, claiming to be the messiah was not necessarily blasphemous—others had done so without penalty, as the messiah was expected to be Israel’s future deliverer and king. Likewise, being called “Son of God” was not unusual, nor was predicting the coming of the Son of Man on the clouds, as foretold in Daniel.

Historically, Jesus does not appear to commit blasphemy in Mark’s account. The charge likely reflects Mark’s theological perspective, projecting the Christian understanding that Jesus as the Son of Man claimed a divine status. In the narrative, the high priest interprets Jesus’ statement about sitting at God’s right hand as a divine claim, which he considers blasphemous. Thus, the blasphemy is more a narrative device reflecting early Christian beliefs than a literal historical charge.
