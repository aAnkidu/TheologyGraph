The [[ðŸ“œ Mark]] gives us some clues about the community for whom it was written. These readersâ€”or rather, hearersâ€”likely belonged to a Greek-speaking Christian community outside of Palestine. ==Most of them were probably Gentiles, not converts from Judaism.== This is suggested by passages such as Mark 7:3â€“4, where the author explains Jewish customs (like handwashing), something unnecessary for a Jewish audience. ==Interestingly, Mark even appears to misunderstand some practices, implying he himself may not have been Jewish.==

At the same time, the Gospel preserves many deeply Jewish traditions about Jesus. These were likely inherited from the earliest Jewish followers of Jesus and passed down through oral tradition. Mark and some in his community may have converted into Jewish faith through Jesus, worshipping the Jewish God and seeing Jesus as the Jewish messiah whose death brought salvation not just to Israel but to the whole world.

==Markâ€™s community may have been in conflict with a local Jewish synagogue, and this tension may have shaped the Gospelâ€™s portrayal of Jewish leaders as hostile to Jesus.== Following Jesus, in Markâ€™s view, means suffering and rejection, not honor and glory.

But suffering, Mark insists, is not the end. Just as Jesus was ultimately vindicated, so too will be his followers. Mark may have written his Gospel during the early stages of the Jewish War (66â€“70 C.E.), a time of fear and upheaval. The destruction of the Temple, predicted by Jesus in chapter 13, may have confirmed for Mark that the end was near and the Son of Man was about to return. ==Those who remain faithful==â€”even without fully understanding the meaning of their sufferingâ€”==will be vindicated==, just as Jesus was.

==Markâ€™s Gospel is filled with paradoxes== that turn worldly expectations upside down:

- the messiah suffers and dies
    
- life is gained by losing it
    
- greatness lies in humility
    
- power belongs to slaves
    
- wealth is a burden
    
- rejection leads to glory
    

These paradoxes offer hope to a struggling, persecuted community. Their suffering has meaning. Just as Jesusâ€™ suffering led to resurrection, so their pain will lead to redemption.
