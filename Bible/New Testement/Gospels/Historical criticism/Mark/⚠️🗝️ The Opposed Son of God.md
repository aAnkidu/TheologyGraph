[[📜 Mark]]

### 🗝️Opposition to Jesus

#### 1. **Jesus is opposed by Jewish leaders, but not by Judaism**

- Jesus is not portrayed as anti-Jewish:
    
    - He is the **Jewish Messiah**, the **Son of the Jewish God**, fulfilling the **Jewish Scriptures**.
    - He **teaches in synagogues**, **observes Jewish law**, and **respects Mosaic purity** (e.g., Mark 1:44).
- Mark emphasizes that Jesus works **within Judaism**, not against it.

#### 2. **Rising conflict with Jewish leaders**

- Mark 2:1–3:6 contains five escalating **conflict stories**:
    
    - **Forgives sins** → leaders question his authority (2:7)
    - **Eats with sinners** → seen as unclean (2:15–17)
    - **Breaks Sabbath rules** → prioritizes human need (2:23–3:6)

> “The Sabbath was made for humans, not humans for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27)  
> “Is it lawful… to save life or to kill?” (Mark 3:4)

- These are not seen by Pharisees as minor disagreements—**Jesus is portrayed as dangerously subverting core religious practice**.
- Result: **Pharisees ally with [[Herodians]]** to plan his death (3:6).
    

#### 3. **Opposition intensifies through the Gospel**

- After these stories, **Jewish authorities continually initiate disputes** with Jesus (Mark 11:27–12:40).
- Jesus **defeats them in debate**, but their hostility grows.
- The **chief priests eventually convince Pilate** to have Jesus executed.

#### 4. **Why do they want him dead?**

- **Immediate reason**: Jesus is **too popular**, and he **disrupts the Temple** (Mark 11:15–18).
- But Mark frames this as something **deeper**:
    - Jesus is **God’s authoritative Son** on earth.
    - The **leaders of Israel cannot understand him**, just like **no one else** in the Gospel truly does.


## ⚠️ Pharisees 

In Mark’s Gospel, the Pharisees are depicted as Jesus’ chief opponents, frequently challenging and opposing him. However, historically, Pharisees were a relatively small and not particularly influential group during Jesus’ lifetime. Scholars suggest that the strong opposition portrayed in Mark’s narrative may reflect later tensions between early Christians and Pharisees, which shaped the storytelling. For a deeper understanding of the Pharisees’ historical role and later prominence, see the note on [[Pharisees]].
