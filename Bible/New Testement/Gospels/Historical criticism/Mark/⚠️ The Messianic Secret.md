[[📜 Gospel of Mark]]

After Peter’s confession, Jesus instructs his disciples not to tell anyone who he is. Interestingly, Jesus attempts to keep his identity secret on several other occasions in Mark’s Gospel. When he casts out demons, he forbids them to speak “because they knew him” (1:34; cf. 3:12). After healing a leper, he commands him to “say nothing to anyone” (1:43). When raising a young girl from the dead, he strictly orders “that no one should know this” (5:43). Before the discussion with the disciples at the end of chapter 8, he never openly speaks about his identity. Even when someone finally recognizes him as the messiah, he commands silence.

This ironic feature is known as the “messianic secret,” a term coined after German scholar William Wrede proposed a famous explanation in the early 20th century. Wrede argued that the historical Jesus never urged secrecy because he did not actually see himself as the messiah. After Jesus’ death, his followers proclaimed him the messiah, and to reconcile this with Jesus’ apparent silence, the early Christian community invented stories of Jesus commanding silence to explain why he never openly claimed the title.

Scholars differ on the merits of Wrede’s solution, which we will revisit when discussing the historical Jesus in Chapter 16. Here, we focus on the literary function of the messianic secret in Mark’s Gospel. Jesus is clearly the messiah (cf. 1:1), but not the great king or cosmic warrior many Jews expected. Why then the commands to silence? One explanation is that Jesus does not want people to misunderstand him as the kind of [[Messiah]] they anticipated like in [[Mark 8'31-33]]. For Mark, the title “messiah” does not signify earthly grandeur and power but the opposite: Jesus is the Son of God who must suffer and die.
