[[📜 Gospel of Mark]]
[[⚠️ The Charge of Blasphemy according to Mark]]

Mark’s Gospel shows that Jesus’ disciples never fully understand who he is. They betray, deny, and abandon him when he needs them most—Judas hands him over, Peter denies him three times, and the others flee. Their hopes for a victorious messiah who would restore Israel’s kingdom are dashed because Jesus is the Son of God who must suffer and die.

Even Jesus seems uncertain at times, praying in Gethsemane to avoid his fate but ultimately submitting to it. His suffering is public and severe: he is humiliated, beaten, and crucified, crying out in anguish, “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?” ([[Mark 15'34]]). Whether this reflects genuine doubt or deep pain is open to interpretation.

After Jesus dies, two important events happen. 
- First, the Temple curtain tears from top to bottom, symbolizing that God’s holiness is now accessible to all, ending the need for the high priest’s exclusive role and sacrificial system ([[Mark 15'38]]).
- Second, a Roman centurion—an outsider to Judaism—declares Jesus to be “God’s Son” (15:39), showing that Jesus’ true identity is first recognized by Gentiles rather than his own people. [[🗝️ The Acknowledged Son of God]]

Mark’s narrative reveals a reversal: Jesus is rejected by his own followers and community but acknowledged by outsiders, and through his suffering and death, salvation is made possible. The story challenges expectations and leaves readers reflecting on the meaning of Jesus’ identity and [[Crucifixion]].
