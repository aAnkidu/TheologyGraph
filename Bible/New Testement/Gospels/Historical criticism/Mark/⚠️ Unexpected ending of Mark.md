[[📜 Mark]] ends in a strikingly open and unsettling way. After Jesus is buried by
[[👤 Joseph of Arimathea]]—a respected Jewish leader—two women see where the body is laid. The following morning, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome return to the tomb to anoint the body, but instead find the stone rolled away and a young man in white who tells them that Jesus has risen and is going ahead to Galilee (Mark 16:1–7).

The women flee in fear and tell no one, for they were afraid (16:8). This abrupt and silent [[⚠️ Unexpected ending of Mark]] has long puzzled readers. How could the Gospel conclude without the disciples learning that Jesus has been raised? Why is there no resurrection appearance?

Some early Christian scribes were so troubled that they added ==a longer ending== (Mark 16:9–20), describing Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances. Yet modern scholars agree that this longer ending is a later addition and not original to Mark.

==Rather than being incomplete, Mark’s ending appears intentional==. Throughout the Gospel, the disciples fail to understand Jesus’ predictions about his death and resurrection. They never come to grasp his true mission. But Mark’s readers do. They see what the characters do not: that Jesus, misunderstood and rejected, is ultimately vindicated by God.

The silence of the women may function as a literary device, leaving the responsibility to the reader—to continue the proclamation that Jesus, the suffering Son of God, has been raised and goes ahead to lead his followers.
