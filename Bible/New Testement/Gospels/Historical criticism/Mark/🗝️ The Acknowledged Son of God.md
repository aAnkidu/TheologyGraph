[[📜 Gospel of Mark]]

==The healing of the blind man== in Mark 8:22–26 is striking because it takes place in stages, making it the only miracle Jesus performs that is not immediate and effortless. When asked to heal the man, Jesus takes him by the hand, leads him out of the village, spits on his eyes, and asks if he can see. The man replies that he can, but only vaguely—people appear like walking trees. Jesus then lays his hands on the man’s eyes and looks intently at him, after which the man begins to see clearly.

A perceptive reader will recognize the ==symbolism== here in light of the immediate context. In the very next story, the disciples themselves—who until now have been blind to ==Jesus’ true identity==—gradually begin to see who he is, also in stages. This process starts with Jesus asking, “Who do people say that I am?” The disciples answer that some think he is John the Baptist, others Elijah, and some a prophet raised from the dead. Jesus then asks them directly, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter responds on behalf of the group: ==“You are the Christ.”==

Up to this point, Jesus has been misunderstood by family, neighbors, religious leaders, and followers alike. Now, halfway through the Gospel, someone finally recognizes who he is, at least partially. The reader knows Peter’s confession is correct to some extent, since Mark identifies Jesus as the Messiah from the very first verse. Instead of rejecting Peter’s confession, Jesus sternly orders the disciples not to tell anyone about him.

Peter’s identification is only partial. Jesus begins to teach that he “must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and after three days rise again” ([[Mark 8'31-33]]). Jesus is the messiah, but one who must suffer and die—a concept that makes no sense to Peter, who rebukes Jesus.

Peter’s misunderstanding likely comes from his view of the messiah as a future deliverer of Israel, a powerful figure who will usher in God’s kingdom in glory, whether as a warrior-king or cosmic judge. But for Mark, this is only a partial truth. Jesus is the messiah who must suffer and die for the salvation of the world.

Jesus then rebukes Peter: “Get behind me, Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things” ([[Mark 8'31-33]]). The idea of a suffering messiah was anomalous to most first-century Jews, including Jesus’ disciples. For Mark, misunderstanding this truth is to fall into the devil’s temptation.

Thus, Peter has begun to see but not clearly; like the blind man, he partially recovers sight. Partial perception can lead to misperception—people appear like trees, and Jesus appears as the popular expectation of the messiah. For Mark, however, Jesus is the suffering Son of God.
