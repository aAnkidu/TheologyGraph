[[ğŸ“œ Gospels]]
No one knows for certain when Jesus died, but scholars agree that it was sometime around 30 C.E.

In addition, most historians think that
- [[ğŸ“œ Mark]] was the first of our Gospels to be written, sometime between the mid 60s to early 70s. 
- [[ğŸ“œ Matthew]] and [[ğŸ“œ Luke]] were probably produced some ten or fifteen years later, perhaps around 80 or 85. 
- [[ğŸ“œ John]] was written perhaps ten years after that, in 90 or 95.
These are necessarily rough estimates, but almost all scholars agree within a few years.
Perhaps the most striking thing

Our first written narratives of Jesus (i.e., the Gospels) appear to date from thirty-five to sixty-five years after the fact.
