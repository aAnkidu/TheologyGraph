### The Sermon on the Mount

📖 **Structure and Placement**  
The Sermon on the Mount (chapters 5–7) is the first of five major teaching blocks in [[📜 Matthew]]:

- Chap. 10: Instructions to the apostles
- Chap. 13: Parables of the kingdom
- Chap. 18: Teachings on the kingdom and the church
- Chaps. 23–27: Woes against the scribes and Pharisees and apocalyptic discourse

Some scholars suggest that these five blocks recall the five books of [[🧙‍♂️ Moses]], further reinforcing Matthew's portrayal of [[Jesus as the New Moses]].

🧱 **A Matthean Composition** Much of the sermon’s content comes from [[Q Source]], but while Q’s material is scattered in Luke, Matthew arranges it into a unified discourse. ==This suggests that the Sermon on the Mount is a literary creation of Matthew==, crafted to present Jesus as the authoritative teacher of divine law.

> If the Law of Moses was meant to provide divine guidance for Jews as the children of Israel, the teachings of Jesus are meant to provide guidance for his followers as children of the kingdom of heaven.

👑 **The Kingdom of Heaven and the Beatitudes**  
The sermon begins with the Beatitudes (5:3–10), declarations of blessing for those who appear lowly or marginalized:

> Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven…

These blessings reflect an apocalyptic vision ([[Apocalypticism]]): when the kingdom of heaven arrives, the oppressed will be vindicated. The kingdom refers not to life after death but to God's reign breaking into history.

Are these statements universal or directed only to Jesus’ followers? The ambiguity remains. Yet they clearly affirm that righteousness—not status—determines inclusion in the kingdom.

> Those who now mourn will be comforted, those who now hunger for justice will be filled, and those who are persecuted for righteousness will be vindicated.
