[[📜 Matthew]] structures the early chapters of his Gospel to mirror the story of [[🧙‍♂️ Moses]]:

> Herod is like the Egyptian pharaoh, Jesus’ baptism is like the crossing of the Red Sea, the forty days of testing are like the forty years the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, and the Sermon on the Mount is like the Law of Moses delivered on Mount Sinai.

📜 **Messianic Expectations and Jesus**

Jews of the first century expected different types of [[Messiah]]s:
- A king like David
- A cosmic judge on the clouds
- An authoritative priest
- A prophet like Moses

Matthew emphasizes the last image—Jesus as a new Moses:

> Moses himself had said that there would be another prophet like him who would arise among his people (Deut 18:15–19).

📖 **Law and Fulfillment**

Jesus does not abolish the Law of Moses. Instead, he fulfills it and interprets it:

> For Matthew, false religion involves rejecting Jesus, precisely because Jesus is a new Moses.

> This new Moses does not replace the old one, however. Quite the contrary, he is the true and final interpreter of what the earlier Moses recorded in his Law.

> Jesus also gives the divine Law in this Gospel, but for Matthew this law does not stand at odds with the Law of Moses; it is a fulfillment of that Law (5:17).
> [[Matthew 5'17-20]]
