The way most people understand the terms [["Son of God"]] and “Son of Man” today likely differs from how many first-century Jews understood them. Today, “Son of God” usually refers to divinity and “Son of Man” to humanity—so “Son of God” means Jesus’ divine nature and “Son of Man” his human nature. But for many first-century Jews, “son of God” commonly referred to a human (e.g., King Solomon; cf. 2 Sam 7:14), while “son of man” referred to a divine figure (cf. Dan 7:13–14).

In the New Testament Gospels, Jesus uses “son of man” in three ways. Sometimes it is a circumlocution for himself, speaking indirectly rather than directly (e.g., Matt 8:20). Sometimes it refers to his impending suffering (Mark 8:31). Finally, it can denote a cosmic figure coming to enact God’s judgment at the end of time (Mark 8:38), a judgment expected soon in Mark’s Gospel (9:1; 13:30). For Mark, these references to the coming Son of Man point to Jesus himself, returning soon as judge of the earth. Scholars debate which, if any, of these uses can be attributed to the historical Jesus.
