Pagans who heard stories about Jesus and his miracles would have had no difficulty understanding what they meant. Among other things they meant that Jesus was himself divine, a divine man come to earth. [[Demigods]], [[The Life of Apollonius]]

In the Roman Empire, the **emperor actively supported traditional cults** and, in many regions, **became an object of worship himself**. While **emperors were officially divinized after death** by Senate decree, in many provinces—especially outside of Rome—**living emperors were worshipped** during the **New Testament period** as **divine “Saviors”** who had brought peace and protection to the empire.

Though some emperors discouraged this worship, **provincial officials often promoted it**, and **local cults honoring the emperor** were widespread, particularly in **Asia Minor**, where Paul would later proclaim **Jesus as Savior**—in direct contrast to imperial claims.

By the **2nd century CE**, many cities held **public celebrations and sacrifices** on behalf of the emperor or his **“genius”** (the divine spirit associated with his household and personal power). These acts were both religious and political, reinforcing **loyalty to the empire** through ritual.

The imperial cult created a **theological-political challenge** for early Christians, who confessed **Jesus—not Caesar—as Lord and Savior**, often placing them in direct conflict with Roman religious expectations.

[[Religious Tolerance in GRW]]
The Greco-Roman world viewed religion **more like social affiliation**—you could worship the gods of your own city, and also those of any new place you visited or moved to. People were expected to **adapt to local cults** without abandoning their original gods. Religion was **non-exclusive**: worshipping one god did **not preclude worshipping others**.

Refusing to offer **sacrifice to the gods or to the emperor’s genius** was not seen as private religious dissent but as a **political act of defiance**, similar to rejecting the legitimacy of the state itself. Since **many gods were believed to exist**, and all were thought to deserve worship, **refusal to participate in public cults** seemed socially and politically irrational.

[[Mystery cults]]
Scholars in the earlier part of this century were struck by how similar the ancient descriptions of the mysteries were to what we know about Christianity; for it too was a secretive society whose members worshipped a divine being who died and was raised from the dead, and who could bring peace on earth and eternal life after death. Initiates into the society went through a period of ritual purification (baptism) and instruction, and members, according to this view, periodically celebrated the myths of the cults beginning (in the Lord’s
Supper).

Recent scholarship, however, has been less inclined to call Christianity a mystery cult, or to claim that it simply borrowed its characteristic ideas and practices from previously existing religions. In part this is because we do not know very much about what happened during the mystery rituals, especially in the period when Christianity began. For example, did they typically partake of a meal, commemorating the death of their savior god? We simply don’t
know.

All the same, the broad parallels between Christianity and these other religions do
remain intriguing and worthy of reflection. Maybe the question scholars have asked should
be posed differently: would non-Christian outsiders have looked upon Christianity as a kind
of mystery cult, analogous to others that they knew?

[[Jewish mythology]]

Jews, too, believed that there were immortal beings, far greater in power than humans, who existed somewhere between them and the true God. In the modern world we might call these beings angels and archangels; for ancient Jews they also included such beings as the “cherubim” and “seraphim.”

The key difference between Jews and persons of other religions, then, was not that Jews denied the existence of a hierarchy of supernatural beings; the difference was that Jews as a rule insisted that only the one Creator God, the supreme deity himself, was to be worshipped.

Moreover, this one God was not the unknown and unknowable deity of some philosophers, nor was he the Greek Zeus or the Roman Jupiter.
