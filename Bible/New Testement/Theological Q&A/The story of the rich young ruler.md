For a simple illustration of a potential difficulty in Mark’s narrative that comes to be straightened out by one of the other Synoptics, consider the opening of the story of the rich young ruler. (Actually, the story is somewhat misnamed: even though the man is rich in all three accounts, only in Matthew is he said to be young, and only in Luke is he said to be a ruler! See Matt 19:20 and Luke 18:18.)

**[[Matthew 19'16–17]]**  
Then someone came to him and said, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments...”

**[[Mark 10'17–18]]'**  
As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments...”

If you were to compare these accounts with what you find in **[[Luke 18'18–19]]**, you would find that Luke agrees with Mark nearly word for word (apart from the introduction to the scene). This means that Mark, rather than Matthew, must have been Luke’s source, since the only reason for thinking that any of these Gospels is the source for the others is their verbal agreement. But was Matthew the source for Mark or was Mark the source for Matthew? ([[Markan Priority]])

One of the interesting things about this passage is that the man who approaches Jesus uses the term ==_good_ in both accounts==, ==but in Matthew he uses it to refer to the _deed_ he must do, whereas in Mark he uses it to refer to _Jesus_==. As a result, the ensuing dialogue in Mark makes good sense: Jesus wants to know why the man has called him good when only God is good. But the flow of the dialogue in Matthew seems a bit strange: why would Jesus object to the man asking him about what is good, on the grounds that God alone is good?

One way to understand the redaction of the story is to think that Matthew’s dialogue has become convoluted because he has shifted the adjective away from Jesus and onto the deed that must be done. By doing so, he interrupted the flow of the conversation. What would have compelled him to make the change?

One possibility is that there was something in Mark’s story that proved disturbing to him. On closer examination you may be able to detect what it was. One way to read (or misread) Mark’s account is to think that ==Jesus is claiming not to be good== (“Why do you call me good? There is no one good but God!”). ==If Matthew realized that Jesus’ words might be taken in this way, he may have changed the account slightly simply by moving the adjective _good_.==
