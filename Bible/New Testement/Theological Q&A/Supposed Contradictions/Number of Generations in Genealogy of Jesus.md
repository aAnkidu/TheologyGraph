📜 **The Problem of Fourteen Generations**

> [[Matthew 1'1-17]]
> There were fourteen generations between Abraham and David, fourteen between David and the deportation to Babylon, and fourteen between the deportation to Babylon and the messiah, Jesus.

This numerical pattern suggests that something significant happens every fourteen generations in Israel’s history—its rise under David, its fall through exile, and its redemption in the coming of Jesus.

📏 **Is This Historically Accurate?**

It is easy to test this structure using the Jewish Scriptures, which serve as Matthew’s source for the genealogy up to the Babylonian deportation. But when the list is compared with these records, problems appear.

> Nearly two-thirds of the names in the genealogy are known to us from the Jewish Scriptures, Matthew’s own source for the generations from Abraham to the deportation to Babylon.

> The most glaring problem comes in verse 8, where Joram is said to be the father of Uzziah; for we know from 1 Chronicles 3:10–12 that Joram was not Uzziah’s father, but his great-great-grandfather.

(Read the 1 Chronicles passage for yourself, but bear in mind that Uzziah is called Azariah in this book, as seen by comparing 2 Kgs 14:21 with 2 Chron 26:1.)

📉 **Why Would Matthew Skip Generations?**

> Why, then, would Matthew say that he was his father?

> If Matthew were to include all the generations between Joram and Uzziah, he would no longer be able to claim that there were fourteen generations between David and the deportation to Babylon!

That would undermine the theological message that history unfolds in divine patterns leading to the messiah.
