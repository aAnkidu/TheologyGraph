The term **“messiah”** comes from the **Hebrew word _mashiach_**, meaning **“anointed one”**, and is the exact equivalent of the **Greek word _christos_**. Thus, **“Messiah” and “[[Christ]]” mean the same thing**.

In the **Hebrew Bible** ([[Tanakh]]), the term was used for the **[[Jewish King]]**, who was **anointed with oil** at his inauguration as a symbolic act of **God’s favor** (see 1 Sam 10:1; Ps 2:2). The king was referred to as **“the Lord’s anointed.”**

The term came to refer to a future deliverer of Israel only after the Babylonians overthrew the nation of Judea in 587 B.C.E. and removed the Jewish king from the throne ([[Babylonian exile]]). From that time on, there was no anointed one (messiah) to rule for several centuries (until the Hasmonean rulers, starting in the mid-second century B.C.E.). But some Jews recalled a tradition in which God had told David, his favorite king, that he would always have a descendant  on the throne (2 Sam 7:14–16). This is probably the origin of the idea that there would be a future messiah to fulfill God’s promises, a future king like [[👑 David]] who would rule the people of  God once again as a sovereign nation in the Promised Land.

By the time of the New Testament, **Jewish expectations of the messiah had diversified**:

- Some envisioned a **warrior-king** like [[👑 David]].
- Others anticipated a **cosmic judge** to defeat evil and restore justice.
- Groups like the **Dead Sea Scrolls community** hoped for a **priestly messiah** to interpret God’s law.

Despite these differences, each of these figures was referred to as “messiah” in ancient Jewish sources.

However, in **no pre-Christian Jewish text** is the messiah portrayed as one who **suffers and dies for the sins of others**. That idea emerges only in the **New Testament**, possibly as a **Christian innovation**. It may have combined traditional messianic hopes with the idea—found in texts like **Psalms 22, 69, and Isaiah 53**—that **the righteous suffer unjustly**. Notably, though, **the word “messiah” does not appear in any of those passages**.

Jews in the first century could have meant a range of things by the title messiah, as scholars have come to realize. Many of these meanings, however, can be subsumed under two major rubrics (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive). 

- For some Jews, the messiah was the future king of Israel, who would deliver God’s people from their oppressors and establish a sovereign state in Israel through God’s power. 
- For others, he was a cosmic deliverer from heaven, who would engage in supernatural warfare with the enemies of the Jews and bring a divine victory over their oppressors. Both notions had been around for some time by the first century; both, obviously, were designations of grandeur and power.
