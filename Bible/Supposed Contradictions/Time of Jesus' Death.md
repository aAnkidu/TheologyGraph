#### John 13:1-2, 18:28- 19:31

In Jesus’ time, the **Passover celebration** brought many pilgrims to Jerusalem. Families would prepare symbolic meals, including lamb, bitter herbs, unleavened bread, and wine. Lambs were sacrificed at the **Temple** on the afternoon before the feast. Since **Jewish days begin at sunset**, the **Passover meal was eaten that evening**, starting a new day—also the **beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread**.

According to the **Gospel of Mark**, Jesus' **Last Supper was a Passover meal**, held on **Thursday evening**. On that same day, the disciples prepared the meal, “on the day when the priests sacrifice the Passover lamb” (Mark 14:12). Jesus was arrested that night, tried by the **Sanhedrin**, handed over to **Pilate** in the morning, and crucified at **9:00 a.m. on Friday**—**the day after** the Passover meal.

In contrast, the **Gospel of John** places Jesus' **crucifixion on the day of Preparation**, **before the Passover meal** was eaten. John 19:14 states: _“Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, and it was about noon.”_ Jesus is crucified that same day. This account suggests that **Jesus died at the time the Passover lambs were being slaughtered**.

This results in **a clear timeline difference**:

|Event|Mark|John|
|---|---|---|
|Last Supper|Passover meal (Thursday night)|Not a Passover meal|
|Day of Jesus' Death|Friday, after the Passover meal|Friday, before the Passover meal|
|Time of Crucifixion|9:00 a.m.|After noon|
|Passover Meal|Thursday night|Friday night|

John even notes that the **Jewish leaders avoided entering Pilate’s residence** (John 18:28) so they wouldn’t become ritually impure and miss the **Passover meal that evening**, whereas in Mark, they had already eaten it the night before.
